# MLEA POS v6.0 — Modular Build

This is the **modular** version of MLEA POS: the original single-file app
split into numbered JavaScript modules plus a separate stylesheet, while
behaving **identically** to the monolith.

## ⚠️ Two things you MUST know

1. **Serve over HTTP, not `file://`.** Because the app now loads multiple
   `<script src>` files and a service worker, opening `index.html` by
   double-clicking it (file://) will not work. Run a local web server:
   ```
   # from this folder:
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   # then open http://localhost:8080 in your browser
   ```
   For deployment, any static host works (Apache, Nginx, GitHub Pages, etc).

2. **Load order is mandatory.** The 19 modules must load in numbered order,
   and `19-patches.js` MUST be last. `index.html` already has them in the
   correct order — don't reorder the `<script>` tags.

## File structure

```
index.html              ← entry point (loads CSS + 19 modules in order)
css/
  styles.css            ← all styles (extracted from the old <style> block)
js/
  01-core.js            ← storage-safety polyfill, dialogs, toast,
                          settings + font-size helpers, currencies,
                          global variables, BIR helpers
  02-storage.js         ← LocalDB, FirebaseDB, offline queue, unified DB
  03-security.js        ← PIN hashing (SHA-256+salt), session timer, lockout
  04-license.js         ← license gate + activation
  05-init-login.js      ← initApp, login, sidebar, view switcher (sw)
  06-dashboard.js       ← dashboard view
  07-pos.js             ← POS terminal, cart, split pay, sale complete, void
  08-receipts.js        ← thermal + A4 receipt printing
  09-inventory.js       ← branches, suppliers, POs, products (search+paging)
  10-users.js           ← user management
  11-sales-returns.js   ← sales history, voided, returns
  12-bir-readings.js    ← X/Z readings, BIR setup
  13-reports-misc.js    ← reports, activity log, Firebase setup, backup,
                          settings, low-stock toast, modal, keyboard
  14-dev-console.js     ← hidden developer repair console
  15-pwa-auth-or.js     ← PWA install, Firebase Auth, Cloud OR, receipt hash/QR
  16-bir-books.js       ← sales book, 2550M, expenses, purchases book,
                          audit export, OR reservation
  17-storage-idb.js     ← IndexedDB adapter, storage quota, error boundary
  18-features.js        ← receipt logo, customer DB, barcode, email receipts
  19-patches.js         ← ALL runtime patches + viewMap population + boot.
                          MUST LOAD LAST.
sw.js                   ← service worker (caches all modules for offline/PWA)
manifest.json           ← PWA manifest
firestore.rules         ← Firebase security rules (if using cloud sync)
functions-index.js      ← Firebase Cloud Functions (atomic OR counter)
```

## How the shared-scope split works

All modules share one global scope (no `import`/`export`). A function in
`07-pos.js` can call a function in `02-storage.js` directly, exactly as in
the original single file. The numbered load order guarantees that by the
time `19-patches.js` runs its overrides (e.g. the async `_finalizePay`,
the `renderPOS` customer-chip patch, and the `viewMap` population), every
function it references already exists.

Note: `viewMap` is declared empty in `05-init-login.js` and populated in
`19-patches.js` (after all `render*` functions exist). This is the one
piece that had to move when splitting — `sw()` still references it safely
because `sw()` only runs at click-time, never at load-time.

## Editing tips

- Need to change the POS? Open `js/07-pos.js`.
- Change a colour or layout? `css/styles.css`.
- Add a brand-new view? Define `renderX` in the relevant module, then add
  `viewMap.x = renderX;` in `19-patches.js` and a sidebar link.
- After editing, just reload the page (clear the service-worker cache or
  bump the `CACHE` name in `sw.js` if changes don't show — see below).

## Service worker cache busting

If you edit a module and don't see changes, the service worker may be
serving the cached old copy. Bump the version string in `sw.js`:
```js
const CACHE = 'mlea-pos-v6-modular';   // → change to v6-modular-2, etc.
```
then reload twice.

## Selling note

The source is fully visible to anyone who opens the files (it's client-side
JavaScript). If you sell this, use a **private** GitHub repository and
distribute only to licensed customers.
